`JustWords` is a simple Android game I wrote that is hosted on Google Play.  You can find it [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.startledbadger.words) if you're interested.

This post contains the privacy policy for the game, as Google now think that's a critical thing even for hobbyist stuff.  So, here we go.

Privacy Policy for JustWords
===

JustWords does not collect any user specific information explicitly.  Some of the third party libraries within it may collect such information, for instance in support of advertising and analytics around who has the game installed.  The mechanisms collecting this data are things like the Google Play platform and Unity runtime engine.
Any such information that is collected in this manner should be anonymised by those systems and only used in aggregate.
The developers of JustWords have no access to this information other than in an aggregate form and they will never share, sell or distribute that information willingly.

The End.
